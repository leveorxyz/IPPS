# IPPS

## Context

IPPS (Inter Planetary Payment System) is a blockchain based payment gateway system to enable centralized banks participate in DeFi movement by tokenizing fiat assets. From the early 2000â€™s, payment gateways such as Visa and Mastercard have dominated cashless money transfers through their centralized monopolistic network - which in many ways have given them a price setting capability. IPPS aims to provide a breakthrough in this market by leveraging blockchain network as ground truth and thus remove friction and intermediaries within the fiat money transfer systems

## Core System Components:

- Banks: Banks provide us with users fiat balance in their respective accounts. These assets are then tokenized by minting XX tokens in 1:1 ratio according to their fiat balance.
- Stakers: Stakers stake in favor of these banks, validating and lowering risks for users in case banks opt-out from providing fiat balance to our users against XX token. They are rewarded with a portion of transaction fees and governance tokens
- Users: The users of our platform who can make payments, transfer balance in XX tokens (representing their fiat balance) - Should we charge users/ banks for using our service? 
- Merchants: The business organizations registered within a bank - who pays (subscription fee/ percentage amount - per transaction?) a certain amount when receiving XX tokens from users as payments. (Should we/banks charge them cash-out fees when redeeming XX tokens to fiat?)

- DAO: Stakers and contributors get governance tokens according to their contribution/ staking amount. Holding the governance token they can manipulate protocol parameters.
- Operators (Optional): The operators hold power to freeze an account (EOA) temporarily in case of loss of private keys/ cards until a certain time (maybe 24hrs) - which gives the user time to report lost/stolen card/keys to the DAO. The DAO after evaluating the report can assign a different wallet for him/her. (*As the wallets are whitelisted in contracts, the tokens can be manipulated by the DAO - in case of these incidents and the lost address can be replaced by the new one)
